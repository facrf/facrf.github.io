I am a developer with solid experience in Java and Kotlin, passionate about creating clean, scalable and functional solutions. I have a history of developing APIs, integrating systems and improving performance in critical environments.

In addition to the technique, I value commitment, quality delivery and respect for the client and the team. I have worked on projects of different sizes, always seeking to apply best practices, such as SOLID, Clean Architecture and automated testing.

I am always open to new challenges â€” whether as a freelancer, consultant or member of high-performance teams.
